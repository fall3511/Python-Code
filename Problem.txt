Write a function in Python that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list. If there are no even numbers in the list, the function should return 0.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the function should return 6 (which is the sum of 2 and 4). If the input list is [1, 3, 5, 7], the function should return 0.
